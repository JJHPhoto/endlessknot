# The Endlessknot

### 1. Beginning
This homework assignment was to get a password generator to work. We were given a working HTML page styled with CSS and some JS functions. 

My first course of action was to read through the README & try to pseudocode what I would need to get the password generator to work. I then started to look up YouTube tutorials that would help me figure things out. I have listed the two I found most useful in my resources. I knew they were doing much more complex work than I was, but watching them process and connect things helped a lot. I also read some articles on Sitepoint but most were too vague for me to be helpful. 

### 2. Completing
It took me much longer to complete this than I expected. I was trying to jam too many pieces of a puzzle together and they just didn't fit. I got pretty down on myself and my study group walked me through how to get things better. I took their advice and started over. I kept the parts that seemed to be working and just added them in one at a time. If I got stuck, I worked at it till it was working and then proceeded. The last part was shown to me by our instructor. I was missing a very simple line of code that I should have seen. 

### 3. Resources

My study group. Thank you so much Ian, Thomas & Macz!
