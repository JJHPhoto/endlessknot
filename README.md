# The Endlessknot

### 1. Begining
This homework assignment was to get a password generator to work. We were given a working HTML page styled with CSS and some JS functions. 

My first course of action was to read through the README & try to pseudocode what I would need to get the password generator to work. I then started to look up YouTube tutorials that would help me figure things out. I have listed the two I found most useful in my resources. I knew they were doing much more complex work than I was, but watching them process and connect things helped a lot. I also read some articles on Sitepoint but most were too vague for me to be helpful. 

### 2. Finishing Up
After running into a few issues in my function to generate a password, I took the advice of a TA and decided to break up my one, big "generatePassword" function into a few functions. This was then demo'd by our class instructor, which encouraged me that I was on the right path.
